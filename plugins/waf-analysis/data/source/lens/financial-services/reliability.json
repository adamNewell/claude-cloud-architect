    "description": "An important task of determining the resilience requirements of a workload is to identify data backup and retention needs. Financial institutions may have standards for backup and retention of data in their systems, which may be informed by regulatory requirements. Financial services customers must understand the requirements that apply to the workloads that are running in their environments.",

Include the AWS CloudTrail, CloudWatch Logs, workload, and system logs in the log backup plan. In AWS, customers use Amazon S3, Amazon Glacier, Amazon EBS snapshots, and Amazon RDS snapshots for backups of AWS services, and AWS Storage Gateway for on-premises backup to AWS. The AWS Backup service centralizes the management of the backups across the AWS environment by creating tag-based policies to manage the backups.",

Define a frequency and retention time on how long these ransomware backups should be held that aligns with your corporate security strategy.

FSIs can use Glacier Vault Lock and S3 Object Lock mode to store data using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model. Amazon S3 Object Lock has been assessed by Cohasset Associates for use in environments that are subject to SEC 17a-4, CFTC, and FINRA regulations. The Amazon S3 Object Lock mode applied to an object stops users from modifying that object. To track which objects have S3 Object Lock, you can refer to an Amazon S3 inventory report that includes the status of objects. Amazon S3 Object Lock helps you adhere to regulatory requirements that require WORM storage, or add another layer of protection against object changes and deletion.",
