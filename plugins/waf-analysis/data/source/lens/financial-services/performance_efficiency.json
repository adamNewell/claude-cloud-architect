For example, a low-latency trading system needs to preserve the performance of the system above all other factors, and be prepared to compromise on the cost of infrastructure to meet their goals. Within the workload it may be necessary to trade-off between persistent capacity and elasticity to make sure that the application always has the ability to handle peak workloads without needing timed or reactive scaling up. When choosing services consider performance determinism. AWS serverless services like AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate can bring significant performance benefits due to their ability to scale elastically on demand, but this is often coupled with less fine control over the underlying environment. Where the workload performance must be as consistent as possible, consider using Amazon EC2. Consider trade-offs in your application architecture, for example using VPC Peering instead of AWS Transit Gateway to minimize the number of network hops for your most critical traffic.",
