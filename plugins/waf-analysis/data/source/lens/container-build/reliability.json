    "description": "By default, a running container will use the full RAM and CPU of the host system. This can lead to performance bottlenecks on the host and put your workload in a degraded state. Setting RAM and CPU limits on your running container will improve the availability of the host system and the workload. Update the CPU and memory parameters in the task definition or deployment configuration to limit the resources a container will consume.",

    "description": "Given the ephemeral nature of a container workload, data on the container will be lost once the container is restarted and no longer exists. Use mounted volumes, whether block or network file system (NFS), to persist file data for an application. Mounted volumes allow for file data sharing among multiple running containers. For persisting data, use external databases such as Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, or Aurora that provide performance, high-availability, and scalability.",

Decide whether the container build for local testing will run on the developer's machine or remotely.

This could be multiple parent images depending on the containerized application frameworks and languages. An organization could start with a lean image containing company-specific configurations, and teams can add additional software necessary to run different applications.

A hierarchy or layered approach to container images helps with maintenance, cascading of updates to base images, and allows for the reuse of container images.
