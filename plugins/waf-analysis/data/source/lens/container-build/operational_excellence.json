    "description": "It is important to understand what is built into your container image. Starting with a minimal container image will save space and speed up the starting of your container when deployed into production. Many customers create parent images that form the base for what all containers in the organization are built on top of. These parent images are minimal images that put into place requirements and security controls established by the organization.",

    "description": "A major benefit of using containers is to provide the ability for the development team to develop new updates and features using an identical artifact that runs in production. Development, testing, QA, and production environments should be as similar as possible.

Use multi-stage builds to split the build-phase of the image from the final image that will be used to run the application.
