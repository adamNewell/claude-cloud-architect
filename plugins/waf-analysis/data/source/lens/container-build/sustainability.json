    "description": "When designing containerized applications, keep your build manifests up-to-date and aligned with your application needs. A containerized application image starts from a Dockerfile that includes all commands required to include configuration and dependencies. If there are dependencies that are no longer required, removing them from the Dockerfile can reduce the time it takes to build the container image (affecting host resource consumption) and reduce the container image size (reducing the time to pull images and affecting host resources for running and storing container images).",

This can be done by creating images that support multi-architecture.
