    "description": "Data quality can have an intrinsic impact on the success or failure of your organization's data analytics projects. To avoid committing significant resources to process potentially poor-quality data, your organization should understand the quality of the source data, and monitor the changes to data quality throughout the data pipeline. Data source validation can often be performed quickly on a subset of the latest data range to look for data defects such as missing values, anomalous data, or wrong data types.",

Monitoring each job in the pipeline is key to ensure operational excellence.
