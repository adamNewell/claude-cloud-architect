    "description": "Prioritize targets for improvement by reviewing your workloads against the sustainability principles. Migrating workloads from on-premises data centers to the cloud can reduce the workload's carbon footprint by 88%. Regular review of cloud architecture for optimization opportunities can reduce carbon footprints, meaning healthcare workload migrations can deliver cloud benefits while simultaneously improving sustainability.",

    "description": "Scale infrastructure to continually match user demand and performance requirements. While many healthcare workloads are life-critical with steady 24x7 demand, other workloads like ambulatory care or revenue cycle workflows exhibit cyclical utilization patterns with peak demand during business hours. Minimize the amount of hardware used by scaling workloads down during periods of low demand.",

    "description": "Analyze demand on workloads to identify components that can be removed or refactored. Engage component owners and stakeholders to redesign clinical workflows and decrease workload infrastructure. Healthcare delivery systems and large ISVs often have sprawling IT footprints with numerous siloed systems. Identifying and removing or refactoring components with little or no use can simplify workflows, decrease cost, and improve sustainability.",
