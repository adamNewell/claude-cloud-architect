    "description": "Design and develop a consumption mapping model that represents a clear view of how tenants are consuming system resources. The goal is to arrive at insights that allow you to allocate a percentage of consumption to each tenant. Look at the overall cost profile and determine which areas contribute most to your AWS bill - focus consumption tracking on those high-impact areas first. For example, if Amazon S3 represents only 1% of your bill, there may be little value in calculating tenant S3 consumption.",
