    "description": "These are two important concepts in the concept of availability. Fault tolerance is the ability to withstand subsystem failure and maintain availability (working properly within an established SLA). To implement fault tolerance, workloads use spare (or redundant) subsystems. Fault isolation minimizes the scope of impact when a failure does occur. This is typically implemented with modularization. Workloads are broken down into small subsystems that fail independently and can be repaired in isolation.",
