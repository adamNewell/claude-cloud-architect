Government jurisdictions have specific compliance and data classification requirements.

The possibilities for a personalized government service delivery must be balanced with maintaining end user control and privacy to maintain public trust.

Modern technologies must allow for continuous and informed consent mechanisms where users can be involved in the decision to share their data.
