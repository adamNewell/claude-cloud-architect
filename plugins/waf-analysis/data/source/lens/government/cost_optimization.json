Most government entities have clear rules around how they assess value for money, but this can be subtly different across jurisdictions. For some countries, value for money is considered whatever is the best functionality for the cost to deliver the desired policy outcome. Other countries take into account the best balance of social, public, and environmental benefits along with cost. Engage with the government organization to understand and document their value for money definition.",

Fortunately, this necessary choice is temporary and works well with cloud economics.
