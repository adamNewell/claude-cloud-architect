It safeguards the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the system and its data. Inspected components include safety faults, infrastructure weaknesses, network threats, software vulnerabilities, and other hazards. Effective security testing involves a mix of manual penetration testing and automated vulnerability scans, offering insights into potential breaches or exposures.",
