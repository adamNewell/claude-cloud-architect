Unlike pushing code changes so that they are accessible to other team members, local commits deal specifically with a developer's individual progress as they develop locally. This practice makes local development safer, enabling developers to freely innovate without fear of losing completed work by capturing snapshots of iterative changes to the code base.",

These hooks can help in the early detection of potential security risks, such as exposed sensitive data or publishing code to untrusted repositories. At a minimum, use pre-commit hooks to identify hidden secrets, like passwords and access keys, before code is published to a shared repository. When discovering secrets, the code push should fail immediately—effectively preventing a security incident from occurring.",

Use static code scanning tools, such as linters, to improve code quality and consistency before pushing committed code. This process can be automated using pre-commit hooks. Upon discovery, pushing the commit should ideally fail and require immediate correction by the developer. Automatically and consistently enforcing coding standards during the local development process directly improves the code review process by removing common errors before manual review.",
