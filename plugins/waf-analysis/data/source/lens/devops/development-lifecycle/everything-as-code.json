  "description": "Everything as code is a software development practice that seeks to apply the same principles of version control, testing, and deployment to enhance maintainability and scalability of all aspects of the development lifecycle, including networking infrastructure, documentation, and configuration. This practice adds the ability to automate more, leading to faster, more consistent, and more reliable development cycles. By using code for as many use cases as possible, developers can achieve a higher level of quality, reduce the risk of errors, and increase the speed at which they can deploy new features and updates.",

By not versioning IaC files, teams lose the ability to track changes over time, identify when specific changes were made, or correlate infrastructure changes with system behavior. Additionally, storing large, monolithic IaC files makes development and management of IaC more complex. Mitigate these challenges by segmenting IaC into modular units consistent with the system's architecture and maintain them within version control systems."
