  "description": "Continuous Delivery is an automated software delivery practice that follows Continuous Integration (CI). It automatically deploys code changes that pass build validation to various environments, including production, with minimal human intervention. This DevOps practice extends to production environments and aims to ensure new features, fixes, and improvements are deployed fast and reliably, reducing lead times and improving overall deployment efficiency.",

When code is built multiple times, there's a chance that inconsistencies occur due to different environments having different configurations, component versions, or updates. This can lead to deployment errors and failures in production that weren't encountered in pre-production environments. The solution is to build the artifact once and always deploy artifacts directly from trusted artifact repositories."

In tightly coupled systems, a change in one component often necessitates changes in others, leading to cascading updates and increased complexity. This makes isolation of changes difficult, increases lead times, and makes the system less resilient. The recommended approach is to architect loosely coupled systems using modular components or microservices, allowing independent updates and deployments."
