  "description": "Strategic instrumentation is a capability aimed at designing and implementing monitoring systems to capture meaningful and actionable data from your applications and infrastructure. This includes collecting telemetry, tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), and enabling data-driven decision making. The goal of strategic instrumentation is to provide deep visibility into your systems, facilitating rapid response to issues, optimizing performance, and aligning IT operations with business objectives by capturing relevant telemetry.",

      "description": "To maximize the impact of observability, it should be closely aligned with both business and technical goals. This means monitoring system performance, uptime, and error rates while understanding how these factors directly or indirectly influence business outcomes such as revenue, customer satisfaction, and market growth. An observability strategy must identify the metrics, logs, traces, and events necessary for collection and analysis, and prescribe appropriate tools and processes for gathering this data. Use technical KPIs such as the four golden signals (latency, traffic, errors, and saturation) to provide a set of minimum metrics to focus on when monitoring user-facing systems.",

Adopt an observability platform that provides observability to teams using the XaaS (X as a Service) interaction mode. Onboarding to the platform should be easy for teams, or support auto-instrumentation to automatically monitor applications for a hands-off experience. The observability platform should offer capabilities to follow requests through the system, the services it interacts with, the state of the infrastructure, and the impact of each of these on user experience.",

Teams should integrate instrumentation libraries into the components of new systems and feature enhancements to capture relevant data points, while also ensuring that pipelines and associated tools used during build, testing, deployment, and release of the system are also instrumented. Chose libraries and tools should support the efficient collection, normalization, and aggregation of telemetry data. Strike a balance between thorough monitoring and the amount of work required to implement and maintain the monitoring solution.",

Usually manifested as a secure and private HTTP health endpoint (for example, /actuator/health), this feature serves as a critical component in monitoring the health status of the overall system, generally including information such as operating status, versions of software running, database response time, and memory consumption. Observability, governance, and testing tools can invoke these health check endpoints periodically, ensuring the continuous evaluation of system health.",

SLOs should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound). The creation of SLOs should be a collaborative effort involving both the business and technical teams. When defining SLOs, rather than using averages, it is preferable to use percentiles for measurement. Teams internally measure and monitor their SLOs to ensure they are meeting the defined business and technical objectives through Service Level Indicators (SLIs).",
