DevOps culture encourages continuous learning and exploration of new technologies, tools, and services. Provide teams with the ability to explore and experiment with new features and services while maintaining organizational security and compliance standards. Structure these exploration opportunities in a controlled, secure manner, to promote agility without compromising integrity. Establish well-defined guardrails that uphold security and compliance when introducing new features and services. This includes access restrictions, acceptable use cases, and alignment with security policies. Create sandbox environments where teams can safely explore and test these features without compromising production environments or violating governance policies. Develop a systematic, scalable onboarding process which allows platform teams to enable guardrails and policies for governing usage of the service, which leads to enabling the feature or service in other environments, including production. Follow the principle of least privilege by granting teams access to use only specific actions or API calls for approved services.",

Automated detective controls are guardrails that continuously monitor the environment, quickly identifying potential risks, and potentially mitigating them. Guardrails can be placed at various stages of the development lifecycle, including being directly enforceable within the environment itself—providing the most control and security assurance. To provide a balance between agility and governance, use multiple layers of guardrails. Use environmental guardrails, such as access control limitations or API conditions, which enforce security measures and compliance ubiquitously across an environment. Embed similar detective and preventative checks within the deployment pipeline, which will provide faster feedback to development teams. The actual implementation of environmental guardrails can vary based on the specific tools and technologies used within the environment. An example of preventative guardrails in AWS are Service Control Policies (SCPs) and IAM conditions.",

Automation and guardrails can greatly ease this process by integrating compliance checks and remediation actions throughout the development lifecycle. This extends to automated enforcement of data access and handling protocols, continuous monitoring of resource configurations for data sovereignty and residency requirements, and automated auditing and risk assessment. Implement automated tools that can enforce data access and handling policies. Set up continuous monitoring systems to assess compliance with data sovereignty and residency requirements. These tools should also be capable of automated auditing, risk assessment, and triggering incident response mechanisms when anomalies or threats are detected. By doing so, your organization can adapt swiftly to changing data privacy laws and regulations, bolster your data security governance, and reduce the risk of data breaches or non-compliance.",

Automated systems can rapidly respond to non-compliant resources, misconfigurations, and insecure defaults as soon as they are detected. In the event of a non-compliance issue, an auto-remediation process should be triggered, which not only resolves the immediate issue but also initiates an alert to the developers. This is important because, while the auto-remediation resolves the problem at the system level, the developers need to be made aware of the problem so that they can correct the source of the error and prevent its recurrence. This dual approach of auto-remediation and developer notification promotes a learning environment and reduces the likelihood of recurring non-compliance issues. It allows developers to address the root cause of the configuration drift or non-compliance to prevent the continual reintroduction of the same error.",

These resources can pile up to create a less than ideal operating environment if not managed effectively, leading to inefficiencies, inflated costs, system unreliability, and heightened security risks. Perform automated scans scoped to all deployed resources in your environment and pinpoint unused or outdated resources. This can be accomplished by using health check endpoints, reviewing logs, using metadata elements such as tags, or checking billing dashboards for utilization. Verify the status and compatibility of software running on these resources, especially if they have been disconnected or powered off for extended periods of time. These checks are especially useful for preventing zombie servers, which have the potential to be rebooted after long periods of disconnection and might be running outdated or incompatible software. Based on the verification results and the organization's policies, take action to remediate these resources, such as updating the software, decommissioning the resources, or integrating them back into the environment.",

      "description": "Software provenance tracking inspects the origin and evolution of software components throughout their lifecycle to understand where a piece of software originated, its development and update history, and its distribution. Provenance tracking ensures the integrity of software, maintains compliance, and enhances the security of the software supply chain throughout the development lifecycle. Effective provenance tracking can prevent the introduction of insecure components, offer early detection of potential vulnerabilities, and provide insights for timely remediation. Developers are encouraged to use the best tools for the task at hand, often including third-party software components. These third-party elements can introduce an additional layer of complexity and potential risk. Implementing software provenance tracking mitigates these risks by promoting better visibility into the lifecycle of software components, thereby increasing accountability, transparency, and trust. Provenance tracking should be integrated into all stages of the development lifecycle. For instance, source code provenance should be tracked at the time of code check-in or commit into Version Control Systems like Git, while the provenance of third-party components should be verified at the time of component acquisition and usage using tools like Software Composition Analysis (SCA). Verify provenance at build and deploy time. Use digital signatures and hashing algorithms to verify the integrity and provenance of software artifacts as part of the deployment pipeline, validating the signature of an artifact against a trusted source before it is used.",

It also allows teams to focus more on development, resolving issues, and innovation, while automation handles the routine tracking and resolution tasks. Use tools that support automated tracking and resolution capabilities. When an issue is detected, a ticket should be created automatically in the tracking system. Once the issue is resolved, the system should be able to automatically validate the resolution and close the corresponding ticket. This approach reduces the chances of human error, ensures a faster response to issues, and is capable of providing comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities to support continuous improvement of the security posture.",

      "description": "Digital attestations are recommended to be created for each action that occurs during the development lifecycle. Attestations serve as evidence of compliance, which can be verified either during or post-deployment. Authorizing deployments by verifying attestations extends a zero trust security model to the development lifecycle. If attestations for the required quality assurance tests, pipeline stages, or manual approvals are missing or invalid, meaning that compliance and change management requirements were not met during the development lifecycle, the deployment can be either prevented or subjected to an exception mechanism for risk acceptance. Incorporate the creation of digital attestations into the development lifecycle. Before deployment, verify that the required attestations have been digitally signed by trusted cryptographic keys and that they meet the change management and compliance policies. If a deployment is found to be non-compliant, you can choose to respond in several ways depending on your security and governance requirements. It can be used as a detective control which allows the deployment to proceed while keeping an audit log of the non-compliance for future investigation. It can also be used as a preventive control, stopping the deployment from proceeding entirely. Pairing this with an exception mechanism you could enforce directive controls to accept the identified risks for a period of time.",
