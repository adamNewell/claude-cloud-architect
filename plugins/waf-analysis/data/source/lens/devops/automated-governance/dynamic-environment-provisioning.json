      "description": "Establish a multi-environment landing zone as a controlled foundation which encompasses all of the environments that workloads run in. A landing zone acts as a centralized base from which you can deploy workloads and applications across multiple environments. Operate the landing zone using platform teams and the X as a Service (XaaS) interaction mode. This enables teams to request or create resources within the landing zone using infrastructure as code (IaC), API calls, and other developer tooling. The landing zone has the benefit of maintaining consistency across multiple environments through centrally-applied policies and service-level configurations.",
