  "description": "Organizations that provide personal and professional growth opportunities are able to improve overall employee satisfaction and enable individuals to be more amenable to adopting new ways of working. While transitioning to a DevOps environment, providing professional skills training to existing employees allows them to become accustomed to and fully utilize new technologies, rules, and practices. By supporting ongoing growth opportunities over time, teams can stay up-to-date with industry trends, identify areas for improvement, and drive innovation, which is critical in the fast-paced world of DevOps.",

In a generative culture, individuals feel comfortable expressing their ideas and opinions without fear, and information is openly shared for improvement. Leaders should promote a culture of openness and inclusivity and provide teams the autonomy and opportunities to experiment and learn from failures. Leaders should model these behaviors and create an environment that promotes collaboration, innovation, learning, and continuous growth.",
