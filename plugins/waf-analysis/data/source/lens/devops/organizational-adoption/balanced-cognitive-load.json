  "description": "Balanced cognitive load is a capability that focuses on maintaining an appropriate level of challenge for team members—neither overwhelming them nor under-stimulating them. The underlying concept is that appropriate cognitive demand encourages learning and mastery without causing burnout or disengagement. This balance is essential for creating sustainable, high-performing DevOps teams. Balanced cognitive load promotes individual job satisfaction, improves performance by enabling team members to process information effectively and retain knowledge, and supports DevOps excellence by fostering a healthy environment for innovation and adaptability.",

As teams grow beyond this size, there is a risk that communication, collaboration, and decision making will suffer, reducing the team's overall effectiveness. Create smaller teams that can communicate more effectively, make better decisions, and deliver higher-quality products and services. This is especially important in the beginning stages of product development; try to keep your teams as small as you can for as long as you can."

In environments that micromanage or over prioritize being risk adverse, individuals tend to shift focus from delivering value to avoiding failure, resulting in sub-optimal outcomes and slower delivery. Embrace a culture of psychological safety that encourages autonomy, experimentation, and risk-taking. Allowing individuals to make decisions and experiment can lead to significant breakthroughs and innovations, as well as higher job satisfaction and performance."
