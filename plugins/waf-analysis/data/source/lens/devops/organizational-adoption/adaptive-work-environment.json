It provides the necessary tools, processes, and support to enable teams to collaborate efficiently, share knowledge, adapt to changing circumstances, and maintain productivity and agility. The adaptive work environment is built on four foundational pillars: inclusive collaboration options, flexible work schedules, adaptable workspaces, and regular team-building activities.",
