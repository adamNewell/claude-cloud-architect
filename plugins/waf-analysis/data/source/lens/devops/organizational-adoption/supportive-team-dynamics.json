  "description": "Supportive team dynamics are essential to DevOps adoption as it promotes a sense of ownership, autonomy, shared accountability, and collaboration among team members. DevOps adoption requires teams to take on new responsibilities, such as cost optimization, operations, security, and availability. Historically, these new responsibilities might have been handled by teams outside of their own. Healthy, effective teams are able to incorporate new responsibilities, respond quickly to changing business needs, and maintain focus on delivering high-quality products to their customers.",

      "description": "To optimize the value stream and achieve desired business outcomes, embrace the four team topologies model. Assess each team and categorize them into one of the four topologies: stream-aligned teams (responsible for delivering value to customers by focusing on specific product lines or customer segments), platform teams (create and maintain shared infrastructure, tools, and services), enabling teams (support other teams by providing just-in-time skills, knowledge, and expertise), and complicated subsystem teams (responsible for specialized subsystems within a larger system that require complex, deep domain knowledge). Organizing teams according to these topologies allows organizations to manage dependencies, enhance collaboration, and facilitate effective value delivery.",

Selecting the right operating model involves evaluating the organization's requirements, such as decision-making processes, communication channels, and resource allocation. Keep in mind that multiple operating models can be used concurrently, catering to different use cases, levels of organizational maturity, and individual team and product needs. Not all operating models support a DevOps culture, and DevOps might not be suitable for every system.",

The team responsible for building a system should also be responsible for running, maintaining, and overall owning it. These small, autonomous teams with a single-threaded focus minimize handoffs and make teams both the creators and custodians of their products. Value stream ownership does not mean preventing teams from working together. Teams not only own the development of their product, but also take responsibility of aspects like security and quality assurance. Invest in ongoing cross-functional training to help individual team members acquire skills that will make them successful within their value streams.",

Adopt a Guardian Model within your organization to scale centralized functions. This involves embedding specialized champions or 'Guardians' within individual teams to enhance and scale the capabilities of centralized functions, such as security, quality, and audit. Embedding guardians directly into teams helps make specialized knowledge always available, reducing wait times and facilitating real-time, context-aware decision-making.",

Project-based teams tend to focus on completing tasks and moving on to the next assignment, rather than fostering long-term ownership, accountability, and continuous improvement. This can impact delivery speed, quality, and maintainability of resulting products. Shift the focus towards product-aligned teams that have ownership of their entire value stream, encouraging teams to take responsibility for the full lifecycle of the product, from idea to delivery and ongoing maintenance."

Requiring teams to use a standardized tool, which may be the wrong tool for the specific use case, can lead to sub-optimal solutions and decreased developer productivity. To overcome this, supportive teams should take a more flexible approach by creating solutions that are inclusive of using multiple tools, frameworks, and programming languages. This encourages teams to choose tools for their specific needs, creating an adaptable development environment that fosters a culture of experimentation and learning."

When decisions are always made by executive leadership and individual teams lack autonomy, it can suppress innovation, delay time to market, and deter accountability. These structures can also discourage teams from collaborating freely, due to potential political dynamics or fear of overstepping boundaries. To address this, create an environment where teams have the autonomy to make decisions that align with their goals and the organization's business objectives. Encourage open channels of communication across all levels and departments."
